## What is a Theme in Emotion/React?

A theme in Emotion/React is a collection of styles that are applied to the various components of your React application. This allows you to maintain a consistent look and feel across your application by defining common styles in one place.

## What's in the Theme Folder?

The theme folder contains all the necessary files to define and manage themes in your Emotion/React application. These files include:

index.js: This file is the main entry point for your theme. It exports an object containing all the theme-related values, such as colors, fonts, and other styles.

theme.js: This file defines the default theme values for your application. It is also the place where you can define custom theme values, such as brand colors, typography, and spacing.

utils.js: This file contains utility functions that can be used to manipulate theme values. These functions are helpful for creating responsive designs and dynamic themes.
