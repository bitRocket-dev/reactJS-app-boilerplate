## The Functionality of the "Hooks" Folder Containing Custom Hooks in React

In React, custom hooks are a powerful tool that can be used to encapsulate and reuse logic across different components. These hooks are functions that use the built-in hooks provided by React (such as useState and useEffect) to provide functionality that can be shared and reused throughout the application.

The "hooks" folder in a React project is a common location to store these custom hooks. By placing them in a separate folder, developers can organize and manage their custom hooks in a centralized location, making it easier to reuse and share them across different components.
